# Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with the software platform you
have chosen (Java, .NET, node.js) through the creation of a dashboard.

To do this, you need to implement a web application that works like [Netvibes](https://www.netvibes.com/en).

This project must use Docker (with a docker-compose)
