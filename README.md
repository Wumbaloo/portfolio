# Portfolio

The purpose of this project is to make me a new portfolio with Docker, an ORM and editable directly online (because it's lazy to build the project and upload it through FTP, all users like to have a backoffice)

This project must use Docker (with a docker-compose)

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```
